# SublimeTours

This object-orientated application provides a business solution to the fictional travel company 'Sublime Tours'. The application allows staff at Sublime Tours to create a tour for passengers outlining the start and end dates for the tour, maximum number of passengers, travel distance of
the tour, cost mark-up as well as set different kinds of cost items for the tour.

Different cost items follow an object-orientated hierarchical structure allowing cost items to be polymorphic i.e. respond to the same message differently.
